# PRIORITY FOR DEMO DAY

- conversational chips :(
- homepage layout
- style toast notifications [07.25.25-2303-toast-design-system-integration]
- watch providers not always showing up
- play button on trailer
- animation needs to be more fun

If I have time:
- border gradients
- animation for chat page


Whole sheabang 

two modes for LLM:
- conversational (still need to differentiate between genie and user text -- better ui)
- movie recs (only shows movies with "Why it's right for you")

## BUGS
- Sometimes shows more than 3 posters
- Under the Skin shows wrong movie (Sob a Pele??)

## POLISH
- Style better: chips
- Style better: Start chat hero button 

- update icons in Watchlist and Watch history
- change font to Inter mayvbe?
- why does the font look weird for "My Watchlist" and basically all main titles on pages (tate profile, watch history)
- change font color for Taste Profile page

- text box above poster (in chat view) sometimes crops info (too small)

## UX
- movies without a poster don't have a clickable link -- can we not show them at all?
- Allow user to access all the posters that came up during a conversation -- possible solution: caroussel

### AI character:
- too eager to give recommendations
- repeats the same sentences / feels like a bot

# BUGS

Bugs:
- also see .notes/bugs
- chips only display after second AI message

# UI / UX


### Chat history:
- add ability to delete / rename chats in the sidebar (add pencil icon at end of recent chats button, on hover, that toggles "edit mode")
- how many chats are we displaying right now?
- stretch goal: search bar?
 
### Chat:
- differentiate genie messages from user messages
- play with result format (list? Allow UI to display lists, there is an issue about that right now)

### Misc.
- Dark/light theme toggle

### Add trailers
