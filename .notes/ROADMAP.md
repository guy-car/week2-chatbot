OVERALL GOAL:
Let's identify features missing to feel comfortable enough to add this app to my portfolio.
It doesn't need to be perfect but user experience should be pleasant.

BUGS----------------
####################

Bugs:
- movies without a poster don't have a clickable link
- also see .notes/bugs
- can't remove movies from watch history

####################
UI / UX-------------
####################

✅ Look / style:
- ✅ consistency of colors 
- ✅ use Sora images

<---------------- ⭐️
<---------------- ⭐️
Posters: THIS IS NEXT <---------------- ⭐️
- different layout for buttons
- make a caroussel / enable users to scroll through all posters fetched during a chat
- Sometimes shows more than 3 posters
- text box above poster (in chat view) sometimes crops info (too small)
<---------------- ⭐️
icon shift around when hovering (maybe tooltip issue)
style toast notifications [07.25.25-2303-toast-design-system-integration]
<---------------- ⭐️

Chat history:
- add ability to delete / rename chats in the sidebar (add pencil icon at end of recent chats button, on hover, that toggles "edit mode")
 
Chat:
- differentiate genie messages from user messages
- play with result format (list? Allow UI to display lists, there is an issue about that right now)

Chips:
- improve look
- make sure they display after first message ⭐️

Misc.
- Dark/light theme toggle
- Delete individual chats
- style toaster notifications to be more consistent with overall aesthetics

AI character:
- too eager to give recommendations
- repeats the same sentences / feels like a bot

CHAT HISTORY ⭐️
- it takes to refresh the page so the current chat shows in the recent chat list. Like, if I'm on a chat (say it's called chat001) and I click new chat, I'm redirected to a new chat page with its own need ID, but chat001 doesn't show up in the sidebar / recentChats section. I need to refresh the page for that to happen
- Rename/edit chat titles
