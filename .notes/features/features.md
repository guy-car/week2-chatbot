## Future Improvements: Assistant Message UX & Formatting
- Reduce redundancy between pre-tool and post-tool assistant messages (e.g., avoid repetitive "Let me look that up..." followed by "Here's what I found...").
- Experiment with prompt engineering to instruct the AI to keep pre-tool messages minimal or to only respond after tool calls.
- Consider formatting the post-tool message differently (e.g., as a summary or bullet points) to improve clarity and reduce repetition.
- Explore UI grouping: visually combine pre-tool and post-tool assistant messages into a single "turn" for a cleaner chat experience, while keeping them as separate messages in the data model for flexibility.
