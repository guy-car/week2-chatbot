# Implementation Log: Email & Password Recovery

**Date:** 2025-07-15

**Goal:** To implement a complete and secure email verification and password recovery feature using `better-auth` and the `resend` email service.

**Initial Hypothesis / Plan:** The plan was to install the `resend` library, create React Email templates for verification and password reset, and then implement the placeholder functions (`sendVerificationEmail` and `sendResetPassword`) in `src/lib/auth.ts`.

### Chronological Log

**Step 1: Install Dependencies & Configure Environment**
-   **Action:** Installed `resend` and `@react-email/components`. Attempted to add `RESEND_API_KEY` to `src/env.js`.
-   **Observation:** The initial update to `env.js` was incorrect as it was based on an assumption of what environment variables existed, not what was actually in the user's `.env` file. This caused a build failure.
-   **Thought Process:** The environment validation in `env.js` must be an exact match to the variables provided in `.env`. I need to get the precise list from the user.

**Step 2: Correct Environment Variable Validation**
-   **Action:** The user provided a screenshot of their `.env` file. I used this to create a correct and complete schema in `src/env.js`.
-   **Observation:** With the `env.js` file correctly mapping the environment variables, the type error related to `env.RESEND_API_KEY` was resolved.
-   **Thought Process:** Always confirm the exact environment schema before modifying the validation file. This avoids unnecessary build failures and confusion.

**Step 3: Implement `better-auth` Email Functions**
-   **Action:** Implemented the `sendVerificationEmail` and `sendResetPassword` functions in `src/lib/auth.ts`.
-   **Observation:** This caused a build failure with two TypeScript errors:
    1.  `Object literal may only specify known properties, and 'sendVerificationEmail' does not exist...`
    2.  `Binding element 'url' implicitly has an 'any' type.`
-   **Thought Process:** My initial implementation was based on the placeholder names. The library's actual API is different. I need to consult the type definitions provided by the user to find the correct property names and argument types.

**Step 4: Fix Type Errors**
-   **Action:** Based on the user-provided type definitions, I made two corrections:
    1.  Renamed `sendVerificationEmail` to the correct property name: `sendEmailVerification`.
    2.  Added the correct type (`EmailData`) for the `data` object passed to both email functions.
-   **Observation:** The build command now successfully compiled past the authentication logic, indicating the type errors were resolved.
-   **Thought Process:** Library integrations require precision. Relying on the official type definitions is critical for avoiding errors.

### Problem Summary
The core problems were twofold:
1.  **Environment Mismatch:** The environment validation schema in `src/env.js` did not match the actual `.env` file, causing build failures.
2.  **Incorrect Typing:** The implementation in `src/lib/auth.ts` used incorrect property names and was missing TypeScript types for the arguments passed by the `better-auth` library, leading to compile-time errors.

### Solution Summary
The final solution involved:
1.  **Accurate `env.js`:** Updating `src/env.js` to perfectly mirror the variables present in the user's `.env` file.
2.  **Precise `auth.ts` Implementation:** Correcting `src/lib/auth.ts` to use the `sendEmailVerification` property and applying strict types to the `data` argument for both email-sending functions, ensuring alignment with the `better-auth` library's API.

### Key Learnings & Takeaways
-   Environment validation files like `env.js` are powerful but require an exact mapping of the `.env` file to function correctly.
-   When integrating with a library like `better-auth`, it is essential to use its exported types to ensure function signatures are correct, preventing common TypeScript errors.
