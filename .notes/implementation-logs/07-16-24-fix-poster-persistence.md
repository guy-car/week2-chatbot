# Implementation Log: Fix Movie Poster Persistence

**Date:** 2024-07-16

### Goal
To ensure recommended movie posters persist correctly when a chat is reloaded.

### Initial Hypothesis / Plan
The initial thought was that movie data was not being saved to the database at all.

### Chronological Log
> **Step 1:** Investigated the end-to-end data flow.
> - **Action:** Used codebase search and file reading to trace the process from the `useChat` hook to the `/api/chat-tmdb-tool` route and the `saveChat` function.
> - **Observation:** Discovered that movie data from TMDB was correctly being saved to the `messages.toolResults` JSONB column.
> - **Thought Process:** The issue wasn't in saving the data, but likely in loading or displaying it.

> **Step 2:** Analyzed the client-side loading mechanism.
> - **Action:** Examined the `useEffect` hooks in `src/app/_components/client/chat.tsx`.
> - **Observation:** Found two separate data-loading functions: `loadChat` (which fetched messages without movie data) and `loadMoviesForChat` (which fetched the movie data separately). The rendering logic ignored the data from `loadMoviesForChat`.
> - **Thought Process:** This separation created a race condition and a logical flaw. The component wasn't correctly merging the two data sources.

> **Step 3:** Confirmed the hypothesis with `console.log`.
> - **Action:** Added logs to `chat.tsx` to inspect the structure of loaded messages and the content of the `savedMovies` map.
> - **Observation:** Logs confirmed that loaded messages lacked the `.parts` property that the `extractMoviesFromMessage` function relied on, and that the `savedMovies` map was populated but unused by the rendering logic.
> - **Thought Process:** The movie display logic was only built for live AI responses and was incompatible with messages loaded from the database.

### Problem Summary
The component used separate, asynchronous functions to load chat messages and their associated movie poster data. The rendering logic only attempted to extract movies from the last message in the conversation using a function that was incompatible with database-loaded messages, completely ignoring the correctly loaded movie data for all other messages.

### Solution Summary
The faulty `useEffect` hook in `chat.tsx` was replaced with new logic. The new implementation iterates through all messages, retrieves movie data for each one by first checking for live tool results and then falling back to the `savedMovies` map. It then collects all movies into a single array, sorts them by timestamp, and displays the three most recent ones.

### Key Learnings & Takeaways
Separating the loading of core content (messages) from its related metadata (`toolResults`) can lead to race conditions and overly complex client-side logic. When possible, it's more robust to load all required data for a component in a single, comprehensive query.
