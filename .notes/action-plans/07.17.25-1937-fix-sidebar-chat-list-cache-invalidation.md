# Action Plan: Fix Sidebar Chat List Cache Invalidation

## 0. Guiding Principles & Execution Protocol
> **This preamble is the most critical part of the plan and must be followed strictly.**

1.  **Immutable Plan**: The agent must follow this plan exactly as written and MUST NOT edit it. If a step is impossible, it must stop and report the issue.
2.  **Documentation is Law**: If the plan involves a library, the primary resource MUST be its official documentation. The agent must use the exact component names and props from the documentation.
3.  **One Step at a Time**: The agent will perform only one "Action" at a time and will only proceed after successfully completing the "Verification" step for that action.

## 1. Overall Goal
-   Fix the issue where newly created chats don't appear in the sidebar's recent chat list until the page is refreshed.
-   Ensure chat title updates (when first user message is sent) also update the sidebar immediately.
-   **Explicitly state what is NOT in scope**: This plan does not include implementing chat rename or delete features, though it will prepare the foundation for those features by establishing proper cache invalidation patterns.

## 2. Regression Risks & Mitigation
-   **Risk**: Breaking existing chat creation functionality
  -   **Mitigation**: Test chat creation flow thoroughly after each change
-   **Risk**: Breaking chat title update functionality  
  -   **Mitigation**: Test first message flow and verify title updates work correctly
-   **Risk**: Performance impact from excessive cache invalidation
  -   **Mitigation**: Only invalidate when necessary (on success, not on every mutation call)
-   **Risk**: Breaking server-side rendering of the sidebar
  -   **Mitigation**: Ensure server-side tRPC calls remain functional and don't conflict with client-side cache

## 3. Structured Action & Verification Plan

### Part 1: Investigation & Preparation

-   **Action 1.1:** Review the current chat creation flow in `src/app/_components/client/NewChatComponent.tsx` and `src/app/_components/client/chat.tsx` to identify where cache invalidation should be added.
-   **Verification 1.1:** Confirm that both components use `api.chat.create.useMutation()` without any cache invalidation callbacks.

-   **Action 1.2:** Review the chat title update flow in `src/app/_hooks/useChatTitle.ts` to identify where cache invalidation should be added.
-   **Verification 1.2:** Confirm that the `updateTitle` mutation in `useChatTitle.ts` doesn't invalidate the `chat.getAll` cache.

-   **Action 1.3:** Verify the current sidebar implementation in `src/app/_components/server/AppSidebar.tsx` uses server-side tRPC calls.
-   **Verification 1.3:** Confirm that `api.chat.getAll()` is called server-side and the component is a server component.

### Part 2: Implement Cache Invalidation for Chat Creation

-   **Action 2.1:** Modify `src/app/_components/client/NewChatComponent.tsx` to add cache invalidation to the `createChatMutation`.
-   **Verification 2.1:** Add `const utils = api.useUtils();` and modify the mutation to include `onSuccess: () => { void utils.chat.getAll.invalidate(); }`. Verify the file compiles without errors.

-   **Action 2.2:** Modify `src/app/_components/client/chat.tsx` to add cache invalidation to the `createChatMutation`.
-   **Verification 2.2:** Add the same cache invalidation logic as in Action 2.1. Verify the file compiles without errors.

-   **Action 2.3:** Test the chat creation flow by creating a new chat and verifying it appears in the sidebar immediately without requiring a page refresh.
-   **Verification 2.3:** Create a new chat from both the homepage and from within an existing chat, and confirm both new chats appear in the sidebar list immediately.

### Part 3: Implement Cache Invalidation for Chat Title Updates

-   **Action 3.1:** Modify `src/app/_hooks/useChatTitle.ts` to add cache invalidation to the `updateTitle` mutation.
-   **Verification 3.1:** Add `const utils = api.useUtils();` and modify the mutation to include `onSuccess: () => { void utils.chat.getAll.invalidate(); }`. Verify the file compiles without errors.

-   **Action 3.2:** Test the chat title update flow by sending a first message in a new chat and verifying the sidebar updates with the new title immediately.
-   **Verification 3.2:** Create a new chat, send a message, and confirm the sidebar shows the truncated message content as the chat title without requiring a page refresh.

### Part 4: Comprehensive Testing

-   **Action 4.1:** Test the complete flow: create chat → send first message → verify sidebar updates → create another chat → verify both chats appear correctly.
-   **Verification 4.1:** Confirm that the entire flow works without any page refreshes and that the sidebar always shows the most up-to-date chat list and titles.

-   **Action 4.2:** Test edge cases: rapid chat creation, long message titles that get truncated, and navigation between chats.
-   **Verification 4.2:** Confirm that rapid operations don't cause errors and that the sidebar remains responsive and accurate.

### Part 5: Future-Proofing for Rename/Delete Features

-   **Action 5.1:** Document the cache invalidation pattern established in this implementation for future reference when implementing chat rename and delete features.
-   **Verification 5.1:** Create a brief documentation note in `.notes/implementation-logs/` explaining the cache invalidation pattern and how it should be applied to future chat management features.

-   **Action 5.2:** Verify that the current implementation doesn't conflict with potential future server-side chat management operations.
-   **Verification 5.2:** Confirm that the server-side `AppSidebar` component will continue to work correctly with the new client-side cache invalidation, and that there are no conflicts between server and client tRPC calls.
