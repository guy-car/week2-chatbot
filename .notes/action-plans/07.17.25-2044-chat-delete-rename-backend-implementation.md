# Action Plan: Chat Delete and Rename Backend Implementation

## 0. Guiding Principles & Execution Protocol

1. **Immutable Plan**: The agent must follow this plan exactly as written and MUST NOT edit it. If a step is impossible, it must stop and report the issue.
2. **Documentation is Law**: If the plan involves a library, the primary resource MUST be its official documentation. The agent must use the exact component names and props from the documentation.
3. **One Step at a Time**: The agent will perform only one "Action" at a time and will only proceed after successfully completing the "Verification" step for that action.

## 1. Overall Goal
Implement backend functionality for deleting and renaming chats using tRPC procedures with proper validation, error handling, and cache invalidation. This plan does not include UI implementation - only the backend foundation that will support future UI features.

**Explicitly NOT in scope:**
- UI components for delete/rename buttons
- User interface for editing chat titles
- Toast notification UI components
- Frontend validation (only backend validation)

## 2. Regression Risks & Mitigation

**Risks:**
- Breaking existing chat operations (create, updateTitle)
- Cache invalidation not working properly
- RLS policies preventing legitimate operations
- Database cascade delete not working correctly

**Mitigation:**
- Test existing chat operations after each change
- Verify cache invalidation patterns match existing code
- Test with authenticated user sessions
- Verify database operations in development environment

## 3. Structured Action & Verification Plan

### Part 1: Database Schema and RLS Policy Updates

- **Action 1.1:** Review existing chat table schema in `src/server/db/schema.ts` to understand current structure and RLS policies.
- **Verification 1.1:** Confirm the chat table has `id`, `title`, `userId`, `createdAt` columns and existing RLS policies allow users to access their own chats.

- **Action 1.2:** Add `deleteChat` and `renameChat` procedures to the tRPC router in `src/server/api/routers/chats.ts` using `protectedProcedure` pattern.
- **Verification 1.2:** Run `bun run build` and confirm the application compiles without TypeScript errors.

### Part 2: Delete Chat Implementation

- **Action 2.1:** Implement `deleteChat` procedure in `src/server/api/routers/chats.ts` that accepts a chat ID and deletes the chat with all associated messages using cascade delete.
- **Verification 2.1:** Test the procedure by creating a test chat and verifying it can be deleted successfully using tRPC client.

- **Action 2.2:** Add proper error handling to `deleteChat` procedure for cases where chat doesn't exist or user doesn't have permission.
- **Verification 2.2:** Test error scenarios by attempting to delete non-existent chats and verify appropriate error messages are returned.

- **Action 2.3:** Add cache invalidation to `deleteChat` procedure using the pattern `onSuccess: () => { void utils.chat.getAll.invalidate(); }`.
- **Verification 2.3:** Verify that after deleting a chat, the `chat.getAll` cache is properly invalidated and the chat no longer appears in the list.

### Part 3: Rename Chat Implementation

- **Action 3.1:** Implement `renameChat` procedure in `src/server/api/routers/chats.ts` that accepts chat ID and new title, with validation for minimum 1 character and maximum 40 characters.
- **Verification 3.1:** Test the procedure by creating a test chat and verifying it can be renamed successfully using tRPC client.

- **Action 3.2:** Add input sanitization to `renameChat` procedure to strip HTML tags and block special characters that could cause security issues.
- **Verification 3.2:** Test with various input strings including HTML tags and special characters, verify they are properly sanitized.

- **Action 3.3:** Add proper error handling to `renameChat` procedure for validation errors (empty string, too long, invalid characters).
- **Verification 3.3:** Test error scenarios by attempting to rename with invalid titles and verify appropriate error messages are returned.

- **Action 3.4:** Add cache invalidation to `renameChat` procedure using the same pattern as delete operation.
- **Verification 3.4:** Verify that after renaming a chat, the `chat.getAll` cache is properly invalidated and the new title appears in the list.

### Part 4: Integration Testing

- **Action 4.1:** Test both procedures work correctly with the existing RLS middleware and user authentication.
- **Verification 4.1:** Verify that users can only delete/rename their own chats and that unauthenticated requests are properly rejected.

- **Action 4.2:** Test cache invalidation works correctly with server components by verifying sidebar updates immediately after operations.
- **Verification 4.2:** Perform delete/rename operations and verify the sidebar chat list updates without requiring page refresh.

- **Action 4.3:** Test that existing chat operations (create, updateTitle) continue to work correctly after adding the new procedures.
- **Verification 4.3:** Create new chats and verify the first message title update still works as expected.

### Part 5: Error Handling and Validation

- **Action 5.1:** Implement comprehensive error handling for network errors, database connection issues, and permission denied scenarios.
- **Verification 5.1:** Test error scenarios by temporarily disabling database connection and verify appropriate error responses.

- **Action 5.2:** Add input validation for chat ID format and ensure proper TypeScript types for all procedure parameters.
- **Verification 5.2:** Test with invalid chat ID formats and verify proper error handling and type safety.

## 4. Success Criteria

The implementation is successful when:
1. Users can delete their own chats with all associated messages
2. Users can rename their own chats with proper validation (1-40 characters)
3. Cache invalidation works correctly for both operations
4. Error handling provides clear, user-friendly messages
5. Existing chat functionality remains unchanged
6. RLS policies properly restrict operations to user's own data
7. All operations work through tRPC procedures without requiring REST endpoints
