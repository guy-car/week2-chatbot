# Action Plan: Movie Card Sidepanel Implementation

## 0. Guiding Principles & Execution Protocol

1. **Immutable Plan**: The agent must follow this plan exactly as written and MUST NOT edit it. If a step is impossible, it must stop and report the issue.
2. **Documentation is Law**: If the plan involves a library, the primary resource MUST be its official documentation. The agent must use the exact component names and props from the documentation.
3. **One Step at a Time**: The agent will perform only one "Action" at a time and will only proceed after successfully completing the "Verification" step for that action.
4. **Design System First**: When implementing UI changes, always establish design tokens and component styles before modifying existing components.
5. **Visual Verification**: For UI implementations, include visual verification steps (screenshots, design comparison) alongside functional verification.
6. **Frontend-Specific Steps**: Design system implementation steps (Parts 2-3) only apply to frontend/UI features. Backend features should skip these sections.
7. **Reference Existing Styles**: Before implementing new UI changes, always check existing style documentation in `.docs/knowledge/` and current component styles in `src/components/ui/` and `src/styles/` to avoid duplicating work and maintain consistency.

**Critical Implementation Patterns:**
- **Design Tokens**: Use `src/styles/design-tokens.ts` for all values. The system has cyan (#00E5FF) and orange (#FD8E2C) theme with comprehensive color, spacing, and animation tokens.
- **Template Literal CSS Issue**: Avoid `${tokens.value}` in CSS classes - use hardcoded values for critical interactive states. Template literals break Tailwind's CSS generation.
- **Import Convention**: Use '~' prefix for imports (e.g., `import { ... } from '~/app/...'`), not '@' prefix.
- **Component Architecture**: Server/client component separation. Use client components for interactivity, server components for data fetching.
- **Animation Performance**: Use CSS transforms instead of layout properties for 60fps animations.
- **Design System Integration**: All new components should use variants from `src/styles/component-styles.ts` which source from design tokens.

## 1. Overall Goal

Replace the current 5 floating buttons on movie poster hover with a slide-out sidepanel that contains 5 action icons. The sidepanel will slide out to the right on desktop and slide in from the right on mobile, with a smooth animation that expands the parent container's glow effect.

**Explicitly NOT in scope:**
- This plan does not include modifying the movie data structure or API calls
- This plan does not include implementing new movie actions beyond the existing 5
- This plan does not include modifying the chat interface or other components

**Current MovieCard Pattern:**
- Uses 5 floating buttons with absolute positioning and Lucide React icons (Bookmark, Eye, MessageCircle, ThumbsUp, ThumbsDown)
- Buttons appear on hover with `opacity-40 group-hover:opacity-100` pattern
- Button size: `--button-size: 3.5rem` (56px)
- Background: `bg-black bg-opacity-80` with hover `bg-opacity-70`
- Positioned in corners and center of poster with `absolute` positioning
- Uses `react-tooltip` for tooltips and `react-hot-toast` for notifications

## 2. Regression Risks & Mitigation

**Risks:**
- **Existing functionality breakage**: Current MovieCard hover interactions and button functionality could be disrupted
- **Design system inconsistency**: New tokens might conflict with existing design patterns
- **Mobile responsiveness issues**: Slide-in animation might not work properly on mobile devices
- **Performance degradation**: Complex animations might cause layout thrashing

**Mitigation:**
- **Parallel development**: Create new component alongside existing one before migration
- **Design token validation**: Test all new tokens against existing design system
- **Mobile-first testing**: Test slide-in animation on mobile devices early
- **CSS transform optimization**: Use transforms instead of layout properties for animations

## 3. Structured Action & Verification Plan

### Part 1: Design Token Implementation

- **Action 1.1:** Add new design tokens for sidepanel dimensions and animation in `src/styles/design-tokens.ts`
  - Add `panelWidth: '50px'`
  - Add `posterWidth: '150px'`
  - Add `containerWidthClosed: '150px'`
  - Add `containerWidthOpen: '200px'`
  - Add `slideOutDuration: '400ms'`
  - Add `panelBackground: 'rgba(0,229,255,0.15)'` (derived from cyan theme)
  - Add `iconSpacing: '12px'`
  - Add `panelPadding: '16px'`
  - Add `iconDisplaySize: '32px'` (for consistent icon sizing)
- **Verification 1.1:** Run `npm run build` and confirm the application compiles without errors. Manual testing will be done by the user as we progress.

- **Action 1.2:** Create component styles for the sidepanel in `src/styles/component-styles.ts`
  - Add `sidepanelVariants` with container, panel, and icon styles
  - Use design tokens for all values instead of hardcoded values
  - Include responsive variants for mobile slide-in behavior
- **Verification 1.2:** ✅ Component styles compile without errors and can be imported. Manual testing will be done by the user as we progress.

### Part 2: Icon Asset Integration

- **Action 2.1:** Create icon mapping constants in a new file `src/app/_components/client/movie-card-icons.ts`
  - Map poster icons to their corresponding actions:
    - `star.png` → "Add to Watchlist"
    - `checked.png` → "Add to Watch History" 
    - `light-bulb.png` → "More Info"
    - `thumb-up.png` → "Like"
    - `thumb-down-2.png` → "Dislike"
  - Create standardized icon display size (32px) with aspect ratio preservation
- **Verification 2.1:** ✅ Icons can be imported and displayed correctly. Manual testing will be done by the user as we progress.

- **Action 2.2:** Create reusable icon component `MovieCardIcon` in `src/app/_components/client/MovieCardIcon.tsx`
  - Accept icon path, action type, and click handler as props
  - Handle icon sizing and aspect ratio preservation
  - Include proper accessibility attributes
- **Verification 2.2:** ✅ Icon component renders correctly and maintains aspect ratios. Manual testing will be done by the user as we progress.

### Part 3: Sidepanel Component Architecture

- **Action 3.1:** Create `MovieCardSidepanel` component in `src/app/_components/client/MovieCardSidepanel.tsx`
  - Implement three-layer structure: parent container, poster, sliding panel
  - Use design tokens for all dimensions and colors
  - Include hover state management for slide-out animation
  - Implement responsive behavior (desktop slide-out vs mobile slide-in)
- **Verification 3.1:** ✅ Component renders correctly with proper structure. Manual testing will be done by the user as we progress.

- **Action 3.2:** Implement slide-out animation system
  - Desktop: Panel slides out to the right (50px), container expands 150px→200px
  - Mobile: Panel slides in from right edge towards left
  - Parent container glow effect expands smoothly with container width
  - Use CSS transforms for smooth 60fps animations
  - **Critical**: Use hardcoded CSS classes for animation states, avoid template literals
  - **Performance**: Use `transform: translateX()` instead of `left` property for animations
- **Verification 3.2:** ✅ Animation runs smoothly at 60fps. Manual testing will be done by the user as we progress.

- **Action 3.3:** Integrate action handlers with sidepanel
  - Connect existing action handlers (addToWatchlist, markAsWatched, etc.)
  - Maintain existing toast notifications and error handling
  - Ensure all 5 actions work exactly as before
- **Verification 3.3:** ✅ All 5 actions work correctly. Manual testing will be done by the user as we progress.

### Part 4: MovieCard Component Migration

  - Implement new three-layer architecture with sidepanel
  - Use new poster icons and sidepanel component
  - Maintain all existing props and functionality
  - Include proper TypeScript types

  - Check `MovieGrid.tsx` and `MovieCardsSection.tsx`
  - Verify no layout issues with new component structure
  - Test that movie cards still display correctly in grid layouts

## 5. Rollback Plan

If issues arise during implementation:
1. **Immediate rollback**: Revert to previous MovieCard implementation
2. **Incremental rollback**: Remove new sidepanel and restore floating buttons
3. **Design token rollback**: Remove new tokens if they cause conflicts
4. **Performance rollback**: Simplify animations if performance issues occur

The rollback should maintain all existing functionality while removing the new sidepanel feature.
