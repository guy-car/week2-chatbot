# Action Plan: Sidebar Click-Outside-to-Close Implementation

## 0. Guiding Principles & Execution Protocol
> **This preamble is the most critical part of the plan and must be followed strictly.**

1. **Immutable Plan**: The agent must follow this plan exactly as written and MUST NOT edit it. If a step is impossible, it must stop and report the issue.
2. **Documentation is Law**: If the plan involves a library, the primary resource MUST be its official documentation. The agent must use the exact component names and props from the documentation.
3. **One Step at a Time**: The agent will perform only one "Action" at a time and will only proceed after successfully completing the "Verification" step for that action.
4. **Design System First**: When implementing UI changes, always establish design tokens and component styles before modifying existing components.
5. **Visual Verification**: For UI implementations, include visual verification steps (screenshots, design comparison) alongside functional verification.
6. **Frontend-Specific Steps**: Design system implementation steps (Parts 2-3) only apply to frontend/UI features. Backend features should skip these sections.
7. **Reference Existing Styles**: Before implementing new UI changes, always check existing style documentation in `.docs/knowledge/` and current component styles in `src/components/ui/` and `src/styles/` to avoid duplicating work and maintain consistency.
8. **Preserve Current Behavior**: Maintain existing slide-in animation and header toggle functionality without any visual changes.

## 1. Overall Goal
Add click-outside-to-close and swipe-to-close functionality to the custom sidebar while preserving the current slide-in animation and visual appearance. Users should be able to close the sidebar by clicking anywhere outside of it or by swiping on mobile devices, without needing to use the header toggle button.

**Explicitly NOT in scope:**
- Adding backdrop/overlay visual elements
- Changing the current slide-in animation behavior
- Modifying the header toggle button functionality
- Adding new visual elements or styling changes
- Implementing keyboard shortcuts or accessibility features (to be added later)

## 2. Regression Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Breaking existing sidebar open/close functionality
  - **Mitigation**: Maintain all existing context and state management, test sidebar toggle after each change
- **Risk**: Performance issues from event listeners
  - **Mitigation**: Proper cleanup of event listeners, use efficient event handling patterns
- **Risk**: Mobile touch conflicts with existing interactions
  - **Mitigation**: Test touch interactions thoroughly, ensure swipe detection doesn't interfere with sidebar content
- **Risk**: Memory leaks from uncleaned event listeners
  - **Mitigation**: Proper useEffect cleanup, test component unmounting scenarios

## 3. Structured Action & Verification Plan

### Part 1: Event Listener Implementation

- **Action 1.1:** Add useRef hook to CustomSidebar component to get sidebar element reference
- **Verification 1.1:** Sidebar ref is properly created and can be accessed in component

- **Action 1.2:** Implement document click event listener that detects clicks outside sidebar
- **Verification 1.2:** Click outside sidebar closes it, click inside sidebar keeps it open

- **Action 1.3:** Add proper cleanup of event listeners in useEffect
- **Verification 1.3:** No memory leaks when sidebar opens/closes multiple times, event listeners are properly removed

### Part 2: Mobile Touch Implementation

- **Action 2.1:** Add touch event handlers for swipe detection on mobile devices
- **Verification 2.1:** Swipe gesture is detected and can be measured for distance/velocity

- **Action 2.2:** Implement swipe-to-close logic with appropriate sensitivity thresholds
- **Verification 2.2:** Swipe gesture closes sidebar when threshold is met, normal touches don't trigger close

- **Action 2.3:** Test touch interactions with sidebar content to ensure no conflicts
- **Verification 2.3:** Sidebar content remains fully interactive, swipe detection doesn't interfere with navigation

### Part 3: Integration & Testing

- **Action 3.1:** Test click-outside functionality across different screen sizes
- **Verification 3.1:** Click-outside works correctly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices

- **Action 3.2:** Test swipe-to-close functionality on mobile devices
- **Verification 3.2:** Swipe gesture closes sidebar smoothly, different swipe directions work as expected

- **Action 3.3:** Verify existing functionality is preserved (header toggle, slide animation)
- **Verification 3.3:** Header toggle still works, slide animation remains unchanged, no visual regressions

- **Action 3.4:** Test edge cases (rapid clicking, multiple opens/closes, component unmounting)
- **Verification 3.4:** No errors in console, no memory leaks, sidebar behaves predictably in all scenarios

## 4. Unresolved Questions

### Technical Implementation Questions:
1. **Swipe Direction**: Should swipe-to-close work in any direction (left, right, up, down) or just left-to-right (since sidebar slides in from left)?
2. **Swipe Sensitivity**: What should be the minimum distance/velocity threshold for swipe-to-close? (e.g., 50px distance, 0.5 velocity)
3. **Click Detection**: Should clicking on the header toggle button also close the sidebar, or should it only toggle (current behavior)?
4. **Touch vs Click**: On mobile devices, should both tap-outside and swipe work, or just swipe?

### User Experience Questions:
1. **Swipe Feedback**: Should there be any visual feedback during swipe gesture (like sidebar moving slightly)?
2. **Swipe Animation**: Should the swipe gesture affect the sidebar animation, or just trigger the close action?
3. **Touch Areas**: Should the entire screen outside the sidebar be clickable, or should certain areas be excluded?

### Performance Questions:
1. **Event Listener Scope**: Should the click listener be added to document or a specific container?
2. **Touch Event Optimization**: Should touch events be throttled/debounced to prevent performance issues?
3. **Mobile Detection**: How should we detect mobile devices for swipe functionality?

### Accessibility Questions:
1. **Focus Management**: Should focus be managed when sidebar closes via click-outside?
2. **Screen Reader**: Should screen readers announce when sidebar closes via click-outside?
3. **Keyboard Navigation**: Should Escape key also close the sidebar (to be implemented later)?

## 5. Success Criteria
- Clicking outside the sidebar closes it without affecting the current slide animation
- Swipe gesture on mobile devices closes the sidebar with appropriate sensitivity
- All existing functionality is preserved (header toggle, slide animation, navigation)
- No visual changes or additional elements are added
- No performance degradation or memory leaks
- Works consistently across all screen sizes and devices
