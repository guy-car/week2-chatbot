# Action Plan: Fix Disappearing AI Message Bug

## 0. Guiding Principles & Execution Protocol
> **This preamble is the most critical part of the plan and must be followed strictly.**

1.  **Immutable Plan**: The agent must follow this plan exactly as written and MUST NOT edit it. If a step is impossible, it must stop and report the issue.
2.  **Documentation is Law**: If the plan involves a library, the primary resource MUST be its official documentation. The agent must use the exact component names and props from the documentation.
3.  **One Step at a Time**: The agent will perform only one "Action" at a time and will only proceed after successfully completing the "Verification" step for that action.

## 1. Overall Goal
-   The primary goal is to fix the data persistence bug where only the first part of a multi-part AI message is saved to the database, causing the rest of the message to disappear on page refresh.
-   **Out of Scope:** This plan does not include fixing any other documented bugs, such as duplicate movie recommendations or the poster display limit. It also does not include changing the front-end UX of how the two-part message is displayed; it only ensures the data is saved correctly.

## 2. Regression Risks & Mitigation
-   **Risk:** The fix could inadvertently break the saving mechanism for simple, single-part messages (those that don't use tools).
-   **Mitigation:** The verification plan includes specific steps to test both multi-part (tool-using) and single-part (non-tool-using) messages to ensure both continue to work correctly.

## 3. Structured Action & Verification Plan

### Part 1: Investigation & Context Gathering

-   **Action 1.1:** Read and understand the project's current documentation regarding the chat functionality and its known issues.
    -   Review `.docs/knowledge/chat-data-flow-state-report.md` to understand the overall data flow.
    -   Review `.notes/bugs/chat-bugs.md`, paying close attention to Bug #2 ("Disappearing AI Message on Refresh").
-   **Verification 1.1:** The agent confirms it has read both documents and understands that the core problem is likely in the data saving logic.

-   **Action 1.2:** Read the code for the `saveChat` function located in `tools/chat-store.ts`.
-   **Verification 1.2:** The agent can articulate how the `messages` array is processed and which property is being saved to the `content` column of the database.

### Part 2: Implementation

-   **Action 2.1:** Modify the `saveChat` function in `tools/chat-store.ts` to correctly handle multi-part messages. The logic should iterate through the `parts` of an assistant's message and concatenate the `text` from all `text` parts into a single string. This complete string should then be saved to the `content` field.
-   **Verification 2.1:** Run `npm run build` and confirm the application compiles without any new errors.

### Part 3: Testing & Confirmation

-   **Action 3.1:** Start the application and initiate a new chat session. Use a prompt that reliably triggers a two-part AI response (e.g., "cats" or "helicopters").
-   **Verification 3.1:** Observe the live chat UI and confirm that the two-part message appears as it did before the fix.

-   **Action 3.2:** Refresh the page to force the chat to reload from the database.
-   **Verification 3.2:** Confirm that the full, concatenated AI message is now correctly displayed after the refresh. The second part of the message should no longer disappear.

-   **Action 3.3:** In a new or existing chat, send a simple message that does not require a tool call (e.g., "hello").
-   **Verification 3.3:** Refresh the page and confirm that the simple request and its corresponding simple response are saved and reloaded correctly.
