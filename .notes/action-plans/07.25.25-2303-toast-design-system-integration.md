# Action Plan: Toast Design System Integration

## 0. Guiding Principles & Execution Protocol

1. **Immutable Plan**: The agent must follow this plan exactly as written and MUST NOT edit it. If a step is impossible, it must stop and report the issue.
2. **Documentation is Law**: If the plan involves a library, the primary resource MUST be its official documentation. The agent must use the exact component names and props from the documentation.
3. **One Step at a Time**: The agent will perform only one "Action" at a time and will only proceed after successfully completing the "Verification" step for that action.
4. **Design System First**: When implementing UI changes, always establish design tokens and component styles before modifying existing components.
5. **Visual Verification**: For UI implementations, include visual verification steps (screenshots, design comparison) alongside functional verification.
6. **Frontend-Specific Steps**: Design system implementation steps (Parts 2-3) only apply to frontend/UI features. Backend features should skip these sections.
7. **Reference Existing Styles**: Before implementing new UI changes, always check existing style documentation in `.docs/knowledge/` and current component styles in `src/components/ui/` and `src/styles/` to avoid duplicating work and maintain consistency.

## 1. Overall Goal

Transform the existing `react-hot-toast` implementation to use the design system and create cohesive toast notifications that match the application's visual identity (cyan border, dark teal background, white text, orange accents) while maintaining all existing functionality. The toasts should feel like a natural extension of the existing UI components rather than generic notifications.

**Explicitly NOT in scope:**
- Adding new toast libraries or dependencies
- Creating multiple toast variants beyond success/error/loading
- Implementing new toast functionality beyond current usage
- Adding complex interactive features beyond dismiss functionality
- Modifying the existing toast call patterns throughout the application

## 2. Regression Risks & Mitigation

**Risks:**
- Toast functionality breaking during design system migration
- Hardcoded colors breaking the centralized design approach
- Toasts becoming visually disconnected from the rest of the application
- Performance issues from complex styling
- Existing toast calls throughout the app losing functionality

**Mitigation:**
- Maintain existing toast call patterns while only updating styling
- Use design tokens for all colors to ensure consistency
- Test toast rendering and interactions after each styling change
- Keep styling simple and performant, avoiding complex CSS that could impact performance
- Preserve all existing toast types (success, error, loading, blank) and their behavior

## 3. Structured Action & Verification Plan

### Part 1: Design System Analysis & Planning

- **Action 1.1:** Analyze current toast implementation to identify hardcoded colors and styling patterns
- **Verification 1.1:** Document all current styling elements that need migration: default white background, black text, generic borders, etc.

- **Action 1.2:** Review existing design tokens to identify which colors and styles can be used for toast styling
- **Verification 1.2:** Confirm all required colors, spacing, and effects are available in `design-tokens.ts` or need to be added

- **Action 1.3:** Identify design tokens needed for toast styling that aren't already in the design system
- **Verification 1.3:** List any new tokens needed for toast-specific styling (overlay colors, toast-specific backgrounds, etc.)

### Part 2: Design System Implementation

- **Action 2.1:** Add toast-specific design tokens to `design-tokens.ts` if needed
- **Verification 2.1:** New tokens are exported and can be imported in other files without build errors

- **Action 2.2:** Create toast variants in `component-styles.ts` using existing design tokens
- **Verification 2.2:** Toast variants compile without errors and use centralized tokens

- **Action 2.3:** Create toast-specific utility classes in `globals.css` for animations and effects
- **Verification 2.3:** Toast utility classes are available and can be applied to toast components

### Part 3: Toast Component Updates

- **Action 3.1:** Update `<Toaster />` component in `layout.tsx` to use design system colors and styling
- **Verification 3.1:** Toaster renders with proper background, text colors, and spacing using design tokens

- **Action 3.2:** Configure toast type-specific styling (success, error, loading) with design system colors
- **Verification 3.2:** Each toast type displays with appropriate colors: success (cyan), error (orange), loading (neutral)

- **Action 3.3:** Add design system animations and effects (glow effects, transitions) to toast notifications
- **Verification 3.3:** Toasts have smooth animations and glow effects that match the application's aesthetic

- **Action 3.4:** Update toast positioning and spacing to match design system layout principles
- **Verification 3.4:** Toast positioning is consistent with application layout and responsive design

### Part 4: Integration & Testing

- **Action 4.1:** Test toast rendering across different screen sizes
- **Verification 4.1:** Toasts display correctly on mobile, tablet, and desktop with proper responsive behavior

- **Action 4.2:** Verify toast functionality (success, error, loading, dismiss) works with new styling
- **Verification 4.2:** All toast interactions work as expected with new design system styling

- **Action 4.3:** Test toast accessibility with keyboard navigation and screen readers
- **Verification 4.3:** Toasts maintain proper focus management and accessibility features

- **Action 4.4:** Verify all existing toast calls throughout the application still work correctly
- **Verification 4.4:** Movie card actions, profile updates, chat interactions, and other toast triggers function properly

## 4. Design Specifications

### Toast Container Styling
- **Background**: Dark background matching application theme (`#292929` from `colors.background.secondary`)
- **Border**: Orange border for errors (`#FD8E2C`), cyan border for success (`#00E5FF`)
- **Border Radius**: Consistent with design system (`11px` from `borderRadius.md`)
- **Shadow**: Subtle glow effect using design system colors
- **Spacing**: Use design system spacing tokens for padding and margins

### Toast Content Styling
- **Text Colors**: Use design system text hierarchy (primary: `#FAFAFA`, secondary: `#E5E5E5`)
- **Typography**: Noto Sans font family with proper weights
- **Icons**: Use design system colors for success/error icons
- **Dismiss Button**: Use design system button styling if custom dismiss is implemented

### Toast Type Variations
- **Success Toasts**: Cyan border (`#00E5FF`) with cyan glow effect
- **Error Toasts**: Orange border (`#FD8E2C`) with orange glow effect  
- **Loading Toasts**: Neutral styling with subtle animation
- **Blank Toasts**: Default styling with design system colors

### Animation & Effects
- **Enter Animation**: Smooth slide-in with glow effect
- **Exit Animation**: Fade-out with design system timing
- **Hover Effects**: Subtle glow enhancement on hover
- **Focus States**: Soft white focus indicators for accessibility

### Positioning & Layout
- **Default Position**: Top-right corner with proper spacing from header
- **Responsive Behavior**: Adjust positioning for mobile devices
- **Gutter**: Use design system spacing between multiple toasts
- **Z-Index**: Ensure proper layering with application components

## 5. Success Criteria

The toast implementation will be considered successful when:

1. **Visual Consistency**: Toasts look like a natural extension of the sidebar button and modal design
2. **Design System Integration**: All colors, spacing, and effects use design tokens
3. **Functionality Preservation**: All existing toast features work without regression
4. **Accessibility**: Toasts maintain proper focus management and keyboard navigation
5. **Performance**: Toasts render smoothly without performance degradation
6. **Responsive Design**: Toasts display correctly across all screen sizes
7. **Code Quality**: No hardcoded colors remain in the toast configuration

## 6. Implementation Notes

- **Incremental Approach**: Update one styling element at a time to prevent breaking changes
- **Design Token Priority**: Always use design tokens over hardcoded values
- **Existing Patterns**: Follow the same styling patterns used in sidebar buttons and modals
- **Testing Strategy**: Test each styling change immediately to catch issues early
- **Documentation**: Update any relevant documentation to reflect the new toast styling approach
