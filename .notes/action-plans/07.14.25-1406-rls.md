# Action Plan: Implement Row-Level Security (RLS)

## 1. Overall Goal

The primary goal is to harden the application's security posture by implementing database-level security policies (RLS). This will ensure that users can only access their own data, preventing any potential for data leaks between accounts. This is a foundational security measure for any multi-tenant application.

## 2. Regression Risks & Mitigation

-   **Risk: Incorrect RLS policies could deny access to legitimate users or fail to secure data properly.**
    -   **Mitigation**: The policies must be tested thoroughly in a development environment. This will be done by creating at least two separate user accounts (e.g., one via GitHub, one via email) and verifying that neither user can query or modify the other's data (chats, preferences, etc.).
-   **Risk: A failed database migration could corrupt or lock the database schema.**
    -   **Mitigation**: We will use the existing Drizzle migration system. All SQL changes will be contained within a single, version-controlled migration file. The local database can be easily reset using the project's `scripts/reset-db.ts` script in case of a failed migration attempt.

## 3. Action Plan

-   **Action 1: Create a new Drizzle migration file.**
    -   Run the command `bun drizzle-kit generate` to create a new, empty SQL migration file.
    -   **File to be created**: `drizzle/0002_enable_rls.sql` (the name will be generated, but this is an example).

-   **Action 2: Add SQL to enable RLS and create security policies.**
    -   Edit the newly created migration file to include `ALTER TABLE ... ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;` and the corresponding `CREATE POLICY` statements for each table containing user data.
    -   **File to be altered**: The new migration file from Action 1.
    -   **Content Example for `chats` table**:
        ```sql
        -- Enable RLS for the chats table
        ALTER TABLE public.chats ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;
        
        -- Policy: Allow users full access to their own chats
        CREATE POLICY "Allow full access to own chats"
        ON public.chats FOR ALL
        USING (auth.uid()::text = "userId")
        WITH CHECK (auth.uid()::text = "userId");
        ```
    -   **Tables to secure**: The same pattern must be applied to all user-specific tables, including `messages`, `user_preferences`, `user_movies`, `movie_interactions`, `user`, and `account`.

-   **Action 3: Apply the migration to the database.**
    -   Run the command `bun drizzle-kit push` to execute the SQL and apply the new security policies to the database schema.

-   **Action 4: Thoroughly test the implementation.**
    -   Log in with one user and create data. Log out. Log in with a second user and verify that none of the first user's data is visible. Repeat in reverse. This is the most critical step.
