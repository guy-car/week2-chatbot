# Action Plan: Robust Year-Based TMDB Lookup

## 0. Guiding Principles & Execution Protocol (NEW)
> **This preamble is the most critical part of the plan and must be followed strictly.**

1.  **Immutable Plan**: The agent must follow this plan exactly as written and MUST NOT edit it. If a step is impossible, it must stop and report the issue.
2.  **Documentation is Law**: If the plan involves a library, the primary resource MUST be its official documentation. The agent must use the exact component names and props from the documentation.
3.  **One Step at a Time**: The agent will perform only one "Action" at a time and will only proceed after successfully completing the "Verification" step for that action.

## 1. Overall Goal

- Update the movie/TV lookup tool and backend logic to robustly support and require a `year` parameter for TMDB lookups, using the correct TMDB endpoints and query parameters for both movies and TV shows.
- **Out of scope:** Any use of the TMDB data dump, changes to unrelated chat or UI logic, or major refactoring of the chat pipeline.

---

## 2. Regression Risks & Mitigation

- **Risk:** Breaking existing lookups that do not provide a year.
  - **Mitigation:** Make `year` optional in the schema, but always use it if provided.
- **Risk:** Incorrect API parameter usage (e.g., using `year` for TV or `first_air_date_year` for movies).
  - **Mitigation:** Strictly follow TMDB documentation for parameter names.
- **Risk:** Failing to update prompt/tool description, leading to AI not providing year.
  - **Mitigation:** Update both the tool schema and the system prompt to require year.

## 3. Structured Action & Verification Plan

### Part 1: Tool Schema & Prompt Update

- **Action 1.1:** Update the `media_lookup` tool schema in `src/app/api/chat-tmdb-tool/route.ts` to accept both `title` (string, required) and `year` (number, required for new logic, but fallback to optional for backward compatibility).
- **Verification 1.1:** Confirm the zod schema and tool description require and document both parameters.

- **Action 1.2:** Update the system prompt/tool description to instruct the AI to always provide the year as a separate parameter when recommending a movie or TV show.
- **Verification 1.2:** Confirm the prompt and tool description explicitly require the year.

### Part 2: Backend Logic Update

- **Action 2.1:** Refactor the backend logic in `media_lookup` to:
  - Use `/search/movie?query=...&year=...` for movies when year is provided.
  - Use `/search/tv?query=...&first_air_date_year=...` for TV when year is provided.
  - Fallback to `/search/movie` or `/search/tv` without year if not provided.
- **Verification 2.1:** Confirm API requests use the correct endpoint and parameter for each media type and year.

- **Action 2.2:** Update the scoring logic to prioritize exact title and year matches, with early exit for perfect matches, and minimize popularityâ€™s influence.
- **Verification 2.2:** Confirm the scoring logic prioritizes exact matches and passes tests for ambiguous titles.

### Part 3: Testing & Regression

- **Action 3.1:** Add or update tests to cover:
  - Movie and TV lookups with and without year.
  - Ambiguous titles (remakes, sequels, etc.).
- **Verification 3.1:** All tests pass and demonstrate correct disambiguation.

- **Action 3.2:** Run `npm run build` to ensure the application compiles without errors.
- **Verification 3.2:** Build completes successfully.
