# Action Plan: Implement Email & Password Recovery

## 0. Guiding Principles & Execution Protocol

> **This preamble is the most critical part of the plan and must be followed strictly.**

1.  **Immutable Plan**: The agent must follow this plan exactly as written and MUST NOT edit it. If a step is impossible, it must stop and report the issue.
2.  **Documentation is Law**: If the plan involves a library, the primary resource MUST be its official documentation. The agent must use the exact component names and props from the documentation.
3.  **One Step at a Time**: The agent will perform only one "Action" at a time and will only proceed after successfully completing the "Verification" step for that action.

## 1. Overall Goal
-   Implement a complete and secure email verification and password recovery feature using the `resend` email service.
-   The final implementation will enable users to receive verification emails upon sign-up and reset their passwords if forgotten.
-   **What is NOT in scope**: This plan does not cover creating a UI for managing email templates or an admin dashboard for email analytics. It only covers the functional implementation of sending the two required transactional emails.

## 2. Regression Risks & Mitigation
-   **Risk**: Incorrectly implemented email logic could break the entire authentication flow.
    -   **Mitigation**: Each step is small and atomic. We will add the new dependency, then create the email components in isolation, and only then integrate them into the existing `better-auth` configuration.
-   **Risk**: The application might crash if environment variables (`RESEND_API_KEY`) are missing.
    -   **Mitigation**: The email sending logic will include checks for the presence of the API key and log a clear error message during development if it's missing. The `env.js` file will be updated to include this new variable.
-   **Risk**: Emails might not render correctly across different email clients.
    -   **Mitigation**: We will use `React Email`, which is designed to produce cross-client compatible HTML. We will build simple, robust email templates to minimize rendering issues.

## 3. Structured Action & Verification Plan

### Part 1: Setup `resend` and Environment

-   **Action 1.1:** Run `bun add resend` to add the email-sending library.
-   **Verification 1.1:** Check that `"resend"` appears in the `dependencies` section of `package.json`.

-   **Action 1.2:** Add the `RESEND_API_KEY` to the `env.js` file to make it available to the application.
-   **Verification 1.2:** Confirm that `env.js` now includes a schema definition for `RESEND_API_KEY`.

### Part 2: Create Email Components

-   **Action 2.1:** Create a new directory `src/emails`.
-   **Verification 2.1:** Check that the `src/emails` directory exists.

-   **Action 2.2:** Create a new file `src/emails/VerificationEmail.tsx` containing a basic React Email template for account verification.
-   **Verification 2.2:** Confirm the file `src/emails/VerificationEmail.tsx` exists and contains a valid React component.

-   **Action 2.3:** Create a new file `src/emails/PasswordResetEmail.tsx` containing a basic React Email template for password resets.
-   **Verification 2.3:** Confirm the file `src/emails/PasswordResetEmail.tsx` exists and contains a valid React component.

### Part 3: Implement Email Sending Logic

-   **Action 3.1:** Create a new file `src/lib/email.ts` to initialize the `Resend` client and export a reusable `sendEmail` function.
-   **Verification 3.1:** Confirm the file `src/lib/email.ts` exists and exports a `Resend` instance.

-   **Action 3.2:** Modify `src/lib/auth.ts` to implement the `sendVerificationEmail` function. It should import the `sendEmail` function and the `VerificationEmail` component, render the email, and send it.
-   **Verification 3.2:** Run `npm run build` to ensure the application still compiles without errors after the changes to `src/lib/auth.ts`. [[memory:3243926]]

-   **Action 3.3:** Modify `src/lib/auth.ts` to implement the `sendResetPassword` function. It should use the same `sendEmail` helper but with the `PasswordResetEmail` component.
-   **Verification 3.3:** Run `npm run build` again to ensure the final changes are valid and the application compiles successfully. [[memory:3243926]]
