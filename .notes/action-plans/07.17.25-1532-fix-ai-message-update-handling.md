# Action Plan: Fix AI Message Update Handling

## 0. Guiding Principles & Execution Protocol
> **This preamble is the most critical part of the plan and must be followed strictly.**

1.  **Immutable Plan**: The agent must follow this plan exactly as written and MUST NOT edit it. If a step is impossible, it must stop and report the issue.
2.  **Documentation is Law**: If the plan involves a library, the primary resource MUST be its official documentation. The agent must use the exact component names and props from the documentation.
3.  **One Step at a Time**: The agent will perform only one "Action" at a time and will only proceed after successfully completing the "Verification" step for that action.

## 1. Overall Goal
-   Implement proper message update handling in the `saveChat` function to handle both new messages and updates to existing messages, ensuring AI responses with tool calls persist correctly after page refresh.
-   **Explicitly state what is NOT in scope**: This plan does not include changing the AI SDK configuration, modifying the system prompt, or implementing UI changes for message grouping.

## 2. Regression Risks & Mitigation
-   **Risk**: Breaking simple non-tool-calling chat flows
  -   **Mitigation**: Test both tool-calling and non-tool-calling scenarios after implementation
-   **Risk**: Database race conditions during concurrent updates
  -   **Mitigation**: Use database transactions and add error handling
-   **Risk**: Losing original message content if update fails
  -   **Mitigation**: Keep original content as fallback, add comprehensive error logging
-   **Risk**: Breaking existing message loading functionality
  -   **Mitigation**: Ensure `loadChat` function remains unchanged and test message loading

## 3. Structured Action & Verification Plan

### Part 1: Implementation Preparation

-   **Action 1.1:** Review the current `saveChat` function in `tools/chat-store.ts` to understand the exact filtering logic that prevents updates.
-   **Verification 1.1:** Confirm that the function only handles new messages via `newMessages.filter(msg => !existingIds.has(msg.id))` and has no update logic.

-   **Action 1.2:** Review the database schema in `src/server/db/schema.ts` to confirm the `messages` table structure supports updates.
-   **Verification 1.2:** Confirm the table has `id` as primary key and `content` as text field that can be updated.

### Part 2: Core Implementation

-   **Action 2.1:** Modify the `saveChat` function to separate new messages from existing messages that need updates.
-   **Verification 2.1:** Add logging to show the separation of new vs update messages and confirm the logic works correctly.

-   **Action 2.2:** Implement database update logic for existing messages using Drizzle ORM's `update` method.
-   **Verification 2.2:** Add logging to show successful updates and confirm no database errors occur.

-   **Action 2.3:** Add error handling for failed updates with fallback to original content.
-   **Verification 2.3:** Test with invalid data and confirm error handling works without breaking the application.

### Part 3: Testing & Validation

-   **Action 3.1:** Test the implementation with a tool-calling scenario (movie recommendations) and verify the AI response persists after page refresh.
-   **Verification 3.1:** Confirm that the assistant message content is saved to the database and loads correctly on refresh.

-   **Action 3.2:** Test the implementation with a non-tool-calling scenario (simple chat) and verify normal chat functionality still works.
-   **Verification 3.2:** Confirm that simple assistant messages are still saved and loaded correctly.

-   **Action 3.3:** Test concurrent scenarios by rapidly sending multiple messages and verify no race conditions occur.
-   **Verification 3.3:** Confirm all messages are saved correctly without conflicts or data loss.

### Part 4: Cleanup & Documentation

-   **Action 4.1:** Remove or simplify debugging logs that are no longer needed, keeping only essential error logging.
-   **Verification 4.1:** Confirm the application runs without excessive logging and error handling remains functional.

-   **Action 4.2:** Update the bug report in `.notes/bugs/ai-message-persistence-bug.md` to reflect the fix and mark the issue as resolved.
-   **Verification 4.2:** Confirm the documentation accurately reflects the implemented solution and current state.

## 4. Success Criteria
-   AI responses with tool calls persist correctly after page refresh
-   Simple chat messages continue to work without regression
-   No database errors or race conditions occur
-   Error handling gracefully manages failed updates
-   Logging is clean and informative for future debugging
