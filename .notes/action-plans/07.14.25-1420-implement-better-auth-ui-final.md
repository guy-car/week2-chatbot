# Action Plan: Implement Auth UI (v5 - Documentation-Driven)

## 0. Guiding Principles & Execution Protocol

1.  **The Plan is Immutable**: The agent must follow this plan exactly as written and MUST NOT edit it. If a step is impossible or incorrect, the agent must stop and report the issue.
2.  **Documentation is Law**: The primary resource is the official documentation at **better-auth-ui.com**. The agent MUST use the exact component names and props as specified there, especially for the `<AuthUIProvider>` and `<AuthCard>` components.
3.  **One Step at a Time**: The agent will perform only one "Action" at a time and will only proceed after completing the "Verification" step for that action.

## 1. Overall Goal

To correctly implement a complete and professional authentication experience using the `better-auth` engine and the `@daveyplate/better-auth-ui` component library, following the official documentation.

## 2. The Plan

### Part 1: Enhance Backend & Install UI Dependencies

-   **Action 1.1: Install New Dependencies.**
    -   Run `bun add @daveyplate/better-auth-ui`.
    -   Run `bun add bcrypt` and `bun add -d @types/bcrypt`.
-   **Verification 1.1:**
    -   Check that `@daveyplate/better-auth-ui` and `bcrypt` are listed in `package.json`.

-   **Action 1.2: Update `auth.ts` with New Providers.**
    -   Modify the existing file at `src/lib/auth.ts`.
    -   Add the `emailAndPassword` provider configuration.
    -   Add the `google` provider to the existing `socialProviders` object.
-   **Verification 1.2:**
    -   Run `npm run build`. The application should compile without errors.

### Part 2: Integrate the Auth UI Provider

-   **Action 2.1: Create the `AuthUIProvider` Component File.**
    -   Create a new file at `src/app/providers.tsx`.
    -   In this file, implement the `AuthUIProvider` from `@daveyplate/better-auth-ui`, wrapping the children prop. This is a client component (`"use client"`).
-   **Verification 2.1:**
    -   The file `src/app/providers.tsx` exists and contains the correctly configured provider.

-   **Action 2.2: Update Root Layout to Use the Provider.**
    -   Modify `src/app/layout.tsx`.
    -   Import and wrap the `<body>` content with your new `Providers` component.
-   **Verification 2.2:**
    -   Run the dev server (`bun dev`). The application should load and run without any new errors.

### Part 3: Implement the Dynamic Auth Route

-   **Action 3.1: Create the Dynamic Auth Page.**
    -   Create a new file at `src/app/auth/[pathname]/page.tsx`.
    -   Implement the `<AuthCard>` component from `@daveyplate/better-auth-ui` inside this page.
-   **Verification 3.1:**
    -   Run the dev server.
    -   Navigate to `/auth/sign-in`. The sign-in form should render correctly.
    -   Navigate to `/auth/sign-up`. The sign-up form should render correctly.
    -   **Crucially, both forms should display the social login buttons for GitHub and Google.**

### Part 4: Final Integration and Testing

-   **Action 4.1: Update Header Navigation.**
    -   Modify `src/app/_components/client/HeaderClient.tsx`.
    -   When a user is logged out, show links/buttons that navigate to `/auth/sign-in` and `/auth/sign-up`.
-   **Verification 4.1:**
    -   As a logged-out user, the header links should be visible and navigate to the correct pages.

-   **Action 4.2: Full End-to-End Testing.**
    -   Perform a complete test of all authentication flows.
-   **Verification 4.2:**
    -   Confirm that you can successfully sign up with email, log out, log in with email, log in with GitHub, and log in with Google.
