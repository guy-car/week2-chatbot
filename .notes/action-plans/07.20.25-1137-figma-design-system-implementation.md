# Action Plan: Figma Design System Implementation

## 0. Guiding Principles & Execution Protocol
> **This preamble is the most critical part of the plan and must be followed strictly.**

1.  **Immutable Plan**: The agent must follow this plan exactly as written and MUST NOT edit it. If a step is impossible, it must stop and report the issue.
2.  **Documentation is Law**: If the plan involves a library, the primary resource MUST be its official documentation. The agent must use the exact component names and props from the documentation.
3.  **One Step at a Time**: The agent will perform only one "Action" at a time and will only proceed after successfully completing the "Verification" step for that action.
4.  **Design System First**: When implementing UI changes, always establish design tokens and component styles before modifying existing components.
5.  **Visual Verification**: For UI implementations, include visual verification steps (screenshots, design comparison) alongside functional verification.
6.  **Frontend-Specific Steps**: Design system implementation steps (Parts 2-3) only apply to frontend/UI features. Backend features should skip these sections.
7.  **Reference Existing Styles**: Before implementing new UI changes, always check existing style documentation in `.docs/knowledge/` and current component styles in `src/components/ui/` and `src/styles/` to avoid duplicating work and maintain consistency.
8.  **Preserve Architecture**: Work within the existing server/client component structure in `src/app/_components/` rather than restructuring.

## 1. Overall Goal
Implement the new Figma design system across the application while maintaining the existing Next.js App Router architecture with server/client component separation. The design system will include a dark theme with cyan (#00E5FF) and orange (#FD8E2C) color scheme, glowing effects, and sophisticated UI components.

**Explicitly NOT in scope:** Backend API changes, database schema modifications, or authentication system updates.

**Note:** Sidebar implementation is handled separately in `07.20.25-1531-custom-sidebar-implementation.md`

## 2. Regression Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Breaking existing component functionality during styling updates
  - **Mitigation**: Test each component after styling changes and maintain existing props/interfaces
- **Risk**: Performance issues from complex CSS effects
  - **Mitigation**: Test performance on mobile devices and optimize animations
- **Risk**: Inconsistent styling across components
  - **Mitigation**: Use centralized design tokens and component styles
- **Risk**: Breaking responsive behavior
  - **Mitigation**: Test on multiple screen sizes at each phase

## 3. Structured Action & Verification Plan
