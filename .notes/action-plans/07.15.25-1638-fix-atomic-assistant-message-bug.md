# Action Plan: Fix Atomic Assistant Message Persistence Bug

## 0. Guiding Principles & Execution Protocol
> **This preamble is the most critical part of the plan and must be followed strictly.**

1.  **Immutable Plan**: The agent must follow this plan exactly as written and MUST NOT edit it. If a step is impossible, it must stop and report the issue.
2.  **Documentation is Law**: If the plan involves a library, the primary resource MUST be its official documentation. The agent must use the exact component names and props from the documentation.
3.  **One Step at a Time**: The agent will perform only one "Action" at a time and will only proceed after successfully completing the "Verification" step for that action.

## 1. Overall Goal
-   Ensure that every assistant message (pre-tool, post-tool, etc.) is saved as a new, atomic message with a unique ID, and always appended to the database (never updated/overwritten).
-   **Out of Scope:** This plan does not include UI/UX changes for grouping or formatting messages, nor does it address unrelated chat or movie recommendation bugs.

## 2. Regression Risks & Mitigation
-   **Risk:** The fix could break the saving or loading of simple, single-part messages.
    -   **Mitigation:** Test both tool-using (multi-part) and non-tool-using (single-part) chat flows after the fix.
-   **Risk:** The UI may display multiple assistant messages per turn, which could look odd.
    -   **Mitigation:** This is expected and will be addressed in future UX improvements.

## 3. Structured Action & Verification Plan

### Part 1: Investigation & Preparation

-   **Action 1.1:** Review all code paths where assistant messages are created, assigned IDs, and persisted (especially in `src/app/api/chat-tmdb-tool/route.ts` and `tools/chat-store.ts`).
-   **Verification 1.1:** Confirm that the current logic reuses/updates assistant message IDs for pre-tool and post-tool responses.

### Part 2: Implementation

-   **Action 2.1:** Refactor the message creation and persistence logic so that every assistant message (pre-tool, post-tool, etc.) is assigned a new, unique ID and appended to the database as a new message.
-   **Verification 2.1:** Run `npm run build` and confirm the application compiles without errors.

### Part 3: Testing & Confirmation

-   **Action 3.1:** Start the application and initiate chat sessions that trigger both single-part and multi-part (tool-using) AI responses.
-   **Verification 3.1:** Observe the live chat UI and confirm that all assistant messages (pre-tool, post-tool) are displayed and persisted as separate messages.

-   **Action 3.2:** Refresh the page to force the chat to reload from the database.
-   **Verification 3.2:** Confirm that all assistant messages are correctly reloaded and nothing is lost after a refresh.

-   **Action 3.3:** Test a simple, non-tool-using chat (e.g., "hello").
-   **Verification 3.3:** Confirm that the simple request and its response are saved and reloaded correctly.
