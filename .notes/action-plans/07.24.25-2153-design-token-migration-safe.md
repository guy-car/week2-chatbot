# Action Plan: Safe Design Token Migration with Approval Gates

## 0. Guiding Principles & Execution Protocol
> **This preamble is the most critical part of the plan and must be followed strictly.**

1. **Immutable Plan**: The agent must follow this plan exactly as written and MUST NOT edit it. If a step is impossible, it must stop and report the issue.
2. **No Assumptions**: When the agent finds hardcoded values that don't match design tokens, it MUST stop and ask the user for explicit direction. No guessing whether to add to tokens or replace with existing tokens.
3. **One Step at a Time**: The agent will perform only one "Action" at a time and will only proceed after successfully completing the "Verification" step for that action.
4. **Approval Gates**: The agent MUST get explicit user approval before making any changes to design tokens or replacing hardcoded values.
5. **Visual Verification**: After each change, verify that the visual appearance remains identical unless explicitly changing the design.
6. **Rollback Safety**: Each step must be small enough to easily rollback if something breaks.

## 1. Overall Goal
- Migrate all hardcoded colors, spacing, and styling values to use the centralized design token system
- Ensure that changing values in `design-tokens.ts` actually affects all components that should use those tokens
- Maintain existing visual appearance unless explicitly updating the design
- **What is NOT in scope**: Adding new design tokens for values not currently used, implementing new UI features, or changing the overall design aesthetic

## 2. Regression Risks & Mitigation
- **Risk**: Changing hardcoded values might break the visual design
  - **Mitigation**: Take screenshots before/after each change, make one component at a time
- **Risk**: TypeScript compilation errors from import changes
  - **Mitigation**: Run `npm run build` after each change
- **Risk**: Runtime errors from missing or incorrect token references
  - **Mitigation**: Test functionality after each component update
- **Risk**: CSS class conflicts or specificity issues
  - **Mitigation**: Use the same CSS class structure, just token-sourced values

## 3. Structured Action & Verification Plan

### Part 1: Discovery and Inventory

- **Action 1.1**: Scan the entire codebase for hardcoded color values (hex codes, rgb values, named colors)
- **Verification 1.1**: Generate a comprehensive list of all hardcoded values found with their locations

- **Action 1.2**: Compare each hardcoded value against existing design tokens to identify discrepancies
- **Verification 1.2**: Create a categorized list showing: (a) values that match existing tokens, (b) values that don't exist in tokens, (c) values that seem to be old/deprecated styling

- **Action 1.3**: **STOP and ask user for approval** - Present the discrepancy list and ask for explicit direction on each hardcoded value:
  - Should this be added to design tokens?
  - Should this be replaced with an existing token?
  - Should this be left as-is for now?
- **Verification 1.3**: User has provided clear direction for each discrepancy

### Part 2: Design System Foundation Updates

- **Action 2.1**: Based on user approval, add any new values to `design-tokens.ts` that were approved for inclusion
- **Verification 2.1**: New tokens are properly exported and can be imported in other files

- **Action 2.2**: Update `component-styles.ts` to import design tokens at the top of the file
- **Verification 2.2**: Import statement works and file compiles without errors

- **Action 2.3**: Create utility functions in `component-styles.ts` that convert design tokens to CSS classes (e.g., `bg-[${colors.background.secondary}]`)
- **Verification 2.3**: Utility functions return the exact same CSS class strings as the current hardcoded values

### Part 3: Component Style Migration

- **Action 3.1**: Update the `cardVariants.chat` style to use design token utilities instead of hardcoded values
- **Verification 3.1**: The generated CSS classes are identical to before, and `npm run build` succeeds

- **Action 3.2**: Update `inputVariants.chat` to use design token utilities
- **Verification 3.2**: Input styling appears identical and builds successfully

- **Action 3.3**: Update `buttonVariants.primary` to use design token utilities
- **Verification 3.3**: Button styling appears identical and builds successfully

### Part 4: Chat Component Migration

- **Action 4.1**: Replace the hardcoded chat container background (`bg-[rgb(41,41,41)]`) with the appropriate card variant class
- **Verification 4.1**: Chat container appears identical, functionality works the same

- **Action 4.2**: Replace the hardcoded input field styling with the input variant class
- **Verification 4.2**: Input field appears identical, typing and submission work the same

- **Action 4.3**: Replace hardcoded text colors in spinner and status messages with design token-based classes
- **Verification 4.3**: Text colors appear identical, loading states work the same

### Part 5: Validation and Testing

- **Action 5.1**: Test that changing `colors.background.secondary` in design tokens actually updates the chat window background
- **Verification 5.1**: Background color change is visible in the chat component

- **Action 5.2**: Test that changing `colors.border.primary` actually updates the chat window border
- **Verification 5.2**: Border color change is visible in the chat component

- **Action 5.3**: Run full build and basic functionality test (send a message in chat)
- **Verification 5.3**: Application builds without errors and chat functionality works completely

## Special Notes
- **Approval Gates**: The agent MUST pause at Action 1.3 and get explicit user direction before proceeding
- **Visual Consistency**: Unless explicitly changing design, all components should look identical after migration
- **Incremental Safety**: Each action should be small enough to easily identify and fix any issues
- **Documentation**: After completion, the design token system should be fully functional and documented
