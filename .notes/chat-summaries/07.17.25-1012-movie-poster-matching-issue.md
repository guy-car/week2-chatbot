# Chat Summary: Movie Poster Matching Issue (July 17, 2025)

## Original Request / Feature
- Review the logic and flow for matching movie posters to AI-recommended movie titles in the chat application.
- Research TMDB API and best practices to suggest improvements for higher match accuracy between AI recommendations and displayed posters.

## Challenges
- The current `selectBestMatch` logic in `media_lookup` (see `src/app/api/chat-tmdb-tool/route.ts`) is fragile:
  - Relies on the AI including the year in the title for disambiguation.
  - Popularity bias can cause incorrect matches (e.g., remakes, adaptations, or TV vs. movie).
  - Ambiguous titles and lack of strict filtering lead to mismatches.
- Data flow complexity: "Live" messages and DB-loaded messages store movie data differently, adding to the challenge.

## Successes
- The AI assistant is already prompted to include the year with recommendations, which helps disambiguate some cases.
- The current system does combine movie data from both live and saved sources to display the most recent posters.

## Methods Used That Did Not Work
- Relying solely on popularity and partial title matching in the scoring algorithm.
- Using `/search/multi` endpoint, which includes people and collections, increasing noise.

## Methods Used That Did Work
- Extracting the year from the AI's response and using it in the scoring algorithm (when present).
- Preferring movies over TV shows in ambiguous cases.

## Recommendations & Changes Proposed
- **Switch to `/search/movie` and `/search/tv` endpoints** instead of `/search/multi` to reduce noise.
- **Pass the year as a query parameter** (`year` for movies, `first_air_date_year` for TV) to TMDB, not just use it in scoring.
- **Increase the weight for exact title and year matches** in the scoring algorithm; consider early exit for perfect matches.
- **Reduce or cap popularity's influence** in the score; use it only as a tie-breaker.
- **Add string similarity (e.g., Levenshtein/Jaro-Winkler) for fuzzy matching**.
- **Expose `year` as an explicit parameter in the tool schema** for the AI to use, reducing string parsing errors.
- **Persist successful (title, year) → TMDB id matches** to improve future lookups.
- **Prompt engineering:** further emphasize the importance of including the year in AI recommendations.
- **Optional:** Allow user correction if a wrong poster is shown, and store corrections for future improvement.

## Codebase Changes (Pseudocode)
- Refactor TMDB search logic:
  - If year is present, call `/search/movie?query=...&year=...` or `/search/tv?query=...&first_air_date_year=...`.
  - Score results: exact title + year match → return immediately; otherwise, use improved scoring.
  - Cap popularity bonus.
- Update tool schema to accept `year` as a parameter.
- Add mapping table for (title, year) → TMDB id.
- Update system prompt to reinforce year inclusion.
