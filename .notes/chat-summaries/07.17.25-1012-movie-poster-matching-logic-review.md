# Chat Summary: Movie Poster Matching Logic Review

## Original Request / Feature
- Review the logic and implementation behind movie poster selection in the chat assistant.
- Investigate why the poster shown sometimes does not match the movie mentioned by the AI.
- Research TMDB API and best practices to suggest improvements for higher match accuracy.

## Challenges
- The current system uses a broad TMDB search and a custom scoring algorithm (`selectBestMatch`) to pick the best match, which is fragile.
- Popularity bias and lack of year information can cause the wrong movie (e.g., a remake or more popular title) to be selected.
- The AI sometimes omits the year, making disambiguation difficult.

## Successes
- Identified the root cause: over-reliance on popularity and insufficient filtering by year/title.
- Located the relevant code and confirmed the scoring logic's weaknesses.
- Found that the TMDB API supports more precise search parameters (e.g., year filtering).

## Methods Used That Did Not Work
- Relying on a single `search/multi` API call and post-processing with a scoring algorithm.
- Using popularity as a significant factor in the scoring, which can override correct but less popular matches.

## Methods Used That Did Work
- Parsing the year from the AI's response and using it in the scoring (when available) improved accuracy, but only partially.
- Reviewing TMDB API documentation revealed better endpoints and parameters for targeted searches.

## Recommended Changes (Not Yet Implemented)
- **Switch to Targeted API Calls:**
  - Use `search/movie` with `primary_release_year` and `search/tv` with `first_air_date_year` when a year is available, instead of `search/multi`.
  - This leverages TMDB's internal filtering for much higher precision.
- **Revise Scoring Algorithm:**
  - Massively prioritize exact title matches and year matches.
  - Reduce or eliminate popularity as a deciding factor when year/title match.
  - Increase penalty for year mismatches when no year is provided.
- **Prompt Engineering:**
  - Make it a critical, mandatory rule for the AI to always include the year in recommendations, explaining why it's necessary.

## Description of (Potential) Code Changes
- Pseudocode for improved logic:

```pseudo
if (year is present):
    results = search_movie(title, year) + search_tv(title, year)
    best_match = pick_exact_title_match(results)
else:
    results = search_multi(title)
    best_match = selectBestMatch(results) // with improved scoring
```
- Update the system prompt to make year inclusion mandatory for the AI.
