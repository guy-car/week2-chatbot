# Implementing feature and addressing questions (2025-07-14 19:48Z)

_**User**_

let's work on implementing this feature, any questions before you start?

---

_**Assistant**_

Thanks for sharing the action plan and context! Before I begin, I want to clarify a few details to ensure the implementation matches your expectations and avoids any issues:

1. **Database Platform**: Is your database PostgreSQL? (RLS is a PostgreSQL feature, but I want to confirm.)

2. **User Identification**: The example policy uses auth.uid()::text = "userId". Is your application using Supabase Auth, or do you have a custom auth system? I want to ensure the correct function is used to get the current user's ID in policies.

3. **Tables to Secure**: The plan lists these tables:
   - chats
   - messages
   - user_preferences
   - user_movies
   - movie_interactions
   - user
   - account

   Can you confirm that all these tables have a user-specific column (e.g., userId or similar) that can be used for RLS? If any table is structured differently, let me know.

4. **Migration Workflow**: Is it okay to generate a new migration file using Drizzle, then edit it manually to add the RLS SQL? (This is the standard approach, but I want to confirm you’re not using any custom workflow.)

5. **Testing**: Do you already have test users/accounts set up, or should I include steps/scripts for creating them?

Once I have these answers, I’ll proceed with the implementation steps!
