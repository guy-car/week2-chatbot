why isn't my bun build command working?
I want to use it to test the step by step implementation of a feature

Your current setup is a Next.js project (see your package.json: "next", "react", "react-dom", etc.), and your build scripts use next build, not bun build. Here’s why bun build isn’t working as you expect:

### Why bun build isn’t working

- **Next.js is not compatible with bun build**:  
  The bun build command is a general-purpose bundler for JavaScript/TypeScript projects, but it does not support building Next.js apps. Next.js has its own build process (next build) that handles routing, server-side rendering, static generation, and more.
- **Your entrypoints are Next.js pages, not plain JS/TS files**:  
  bun build expects a single entry file or a set of files to bundle, not a Next.js project structure.

### How to test step-by-step in a Next.js project

If you want to test your feature implementation step by step, you should use:

- **Development mode**:  
  Run npm run dev or bun run dev (since your dev script is "next dev --turbo"). This will start the Next.js development server with hot reloading, so you can see changes as you make them.
- **Build for production**:  
  Run npm run build or bun run build (which runs next build) to test the production build.

### If you want to use Bun for running Next.js

- Bun can run Next.js (with some caveats), but you still use next build and next dev, not bun build.
- You can use bun as your package manager (bun install), and bun run dev/build, but not bun build.

---

**Summary:**  
bun build is not for Next.js projects. Use next build and next dev for building and testing your app. If you want to test features step by step, use the dev server (npm run dev or bun run dev).

ok it looks like npm run build works

_**Assistant**_

Great! That’s expected for a Next.js project—npm run build (or bun run build) will trigger next build, which is the correct way to build your app for production.

**Quick tips for your workflow:**
- Use npm run dev (or bun run dev) for local development and step-by-step feature testing with hot reload.
- Use npm run build to check for production build errors and optimize your app.
- Use npm run start to serve the production build locally.

If you need help with any specific step in your feature implementation or want to automate/test something in your workflow, just let me know!
